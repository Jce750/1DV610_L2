# Test Report for Cell Module
(Please note this was generated by ai)

## Summary
The `Cell` module has been tested using Jest with the jsdom environment. The tests cover the creation of a `Cell` object and its properties, including position and cell size. The tests also verify the attributes set on the HTML element associated with the cell.

## Test Procedure
To replicate these tests, you would need to run the Jest test suite in the project where the `Cell` module resides. The test file contains a `describe` block that sets up the necessary objects (`PositionRowColumn` and `CellSizeWidthHeight`) and runs multiple `it` blocks to perform the tests.
